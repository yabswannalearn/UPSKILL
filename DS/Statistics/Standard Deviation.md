**Standard deviation** is a measure of how spread out a set of data is from its average (or mean).

A **low standard deviation** indicates that the data points are very consistent and tightly clustered around the average. This means the data is predictable.

A **high standard deviation** indicates that the data points are spread out over a wide range, showing high variability and less predictability.

In a data visualization like the `NO_2` graph, this is shown by:

1. **A solid line**, which plots the **average** value at each point in time (e.g., the average pollution level for each hour of the day).
2. **A shaded area** around the line, which represents the **standard deviation**. A narrow band means low deviation (high consistency), while a wide band means high deviation (high inconsistency and unpredictability at that specific point in time).

To create this, data is collected over a longer period (like the entire month of May). For each specific time (like 9:00 AM), all the data points are grouped together to calculate the average and standard deviation for that time, which are then plotted on the graph. This reveals not only the average trend but also how reliable and consistent that trend is day-to-day.
