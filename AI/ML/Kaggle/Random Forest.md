A **Random Forest** is a team of many simple **Decision Tree** experts. It makes them powerful by ensuring the team is **diverse**. It does this by giving each expert a **random** sample of the data and restricting them to **random** questions. The final answer is simply the **average or vote** of all the experts, which is far more accurate and reliable than any single expert's guess.
