parang [[merging_ordered]]

less than or equal to

so as you can see, the closest to B3 5 is 3 D3, that's why it was merged. same goes with B4 and 7 D7.

syntax:

```
so in this merge, you merged on time, for example in the row 1 the time are 10:00 and 9:59, since 9:59 is less than 10:00, it will be merged to that row

we are merging
using [[list comprehension]]
and [[plot]], specifically, [[Bar plots]]

simple explanation of this code:
### ðŸ“Œ What it does:

1. **`merge_asof()`** joins `gdp` with the nearest `recession` status by date.
    
2. **Creates color list**: `'r'` for recession, `'g'` for growth.
    
3. **Plots a bar chart**:
    
    - X = date
        
    - Y = GDP
        
    - Color = red or green based on recession
