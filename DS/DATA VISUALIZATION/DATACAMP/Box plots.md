## Box Plots
use if you have a continuous variable, split by a categorical variable, and when you want to compare the distributions of the continuous variable for each category

A box plot, or box-and-whisker plot, is a simple chart that shows a five-number summary of a set of data: the **minimum**, **first quartile**, **median**, **third quartile**, and **maximum**.

Think of it like this:

- The **box** shows where the middle 50% of your data is.
- The **line inside the box** is the median (the middle value).
- The **whiskers** (the lines extending from the box) show the spread of the rest of the data.
- **Dots** outside the whiskers are outliers (unusual values).

It's a quick way to see the spread and center of your data at a glance.
